Last index of One 
Solution 1: Backward Traversal
1. Understand that we need to find the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the string [1 mark]
2. Traverse the string from the end toward the beginning (right to left) [1 mark]
3. Return the index of the first occurrence of '1' encountered during this backward traversal [1 mark]
4. Return -1 if no '1' is found in the string [1 mark]

Solution 2: Forward Traversal with Variable Tracking
1. Initialize a variable to store the index of the last occurrence of '1', initially set to -1 [1 mark]
2. Traverse the string from beginning to end (left to right) [1 mark]
3. Update the tracking variable whenever a '1' is encountered [1 mark]
4. After completing the traversal, return the final value of the tracking variable [1 mark]

Solution 3: Using Built-in String Functions
1. Use a built-in string function to find the last occurrence of '1' [2 marks]
2. Handle the case when '1' is not present, returning -1 [2 marks]
