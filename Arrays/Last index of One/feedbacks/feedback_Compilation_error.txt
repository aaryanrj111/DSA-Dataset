"Selected rubric"  
Solution 1: Backward Traversal

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Understand that we need to find the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the string [1 mark] 
    - The student understands the problem requirement as they are attempting to find the last occurrence of '1'. [1 mark]  
2. Traverse the string from the end toward the beginning (right to left) [1 mark] 
    - The student attempts to traverse from the end, but the loop condition is incorrect (`i=s.length()` should be `i=s.length()-1`). [0 Mark]
3. Return the index of the first occurrence of '1' encountered during this backward traversal [1 mark] 
    - The student correctly returns the index when '1' is found.  [1 mark] 
4. Return -1 if no '1' is found in the string [1 mark] 
    - The student attempts to return -1, but the syntax is incorrect due to the misplaced `else` statement. [0 Mark]
