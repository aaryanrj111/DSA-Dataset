"Solution 1: Backward Traversal"

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Understand that we need to find the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the string [1 mark] - The student did not demonstrate this understanding as the code returns the first occurrence of '1', not the last. [0 marks]  
2. Traverse the string from the end toward the beginning (right to left) [1 mark] - The student traversed the string from the beginning to the end, not backward. [0 marks]  
3. Return the index of the first occurrence of '1' encountered during this backward traversal [1 mark] - The student returns the index of the first occurrence of '1' but not during a backward traversal. [0 marks]  
4. Return -1 if no '1' is found in the string [1 mark] - The student correctly returns -1 if no '1' is found. [1 mark]
