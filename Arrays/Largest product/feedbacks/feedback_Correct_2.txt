Solution 1: Sliding Window Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initializes variables for window boundaries (i for start, j for end) [0 mark]  
   - The solution does not explicitly initialize variables for window boundaries (i for start, j for end). Instead, it uses a single loop index.

2. Initializes a variable to track the product and a variable to track maximum product found [1 mark]  
   - The solution initializes `windowProduct` to track the product and `maxProduct` to track the maximum product found.

3. Implements sliding window logic to maintain a window of size k [2 marks]  
   - The solution correctly implements the sliding window logic by multiplying the current element to the product and dividing by the element that is sliding out of the window.

4. Correctly updates maximum product when window size reaches k [1 mark]  
   - The solution updates `maxProduct` using `Math.max(maxProduct, windowProduct)` when the window size reaches k.

5. Correctly handles division by the leftmost element when sliding the window [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly divides `windowProduct` by `arr[i-k]` to remove the contribution of the element that is sliding out of the window.

6. Returns the maximum product found [1 mark]  
   - The solution returns `maxProduct` as the maximum product found.
