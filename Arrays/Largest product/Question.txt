Given an array arr and an integer k. You have to find the maximum product of k contiguous elements in the array. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 2
Output: 12 
Explanation: The sub-array of size 2 will be 3 4 and the product is 12.
Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 7, 8] and k = 3
Output: 336
Explanation: The sub-array of size 3 will be 6 7 8 and the product is 336.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxilary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 106
1 <= k<= 8
1<= arr[i] <=102
