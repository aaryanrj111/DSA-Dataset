Selected rubric: Solution 3: Optimized Iterative Approach (Two-Pointer)

Feedback with marks:
1. Find the middle of the linked list using slow and fast pointers technique. [1 mark] - The solution correctly uses slow and fast pointers to find the middle of the linked list. [1 mark]
2. Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the node after the middle. [1 mark] - The solution correctly reverses the second half of the linked list using the `reverseList` method. [1 mark]
3. Compare the first half with the reversed second half by traversing both simultaneously and checking if values match. [1 mark] - The solution correctly compares the first half with the reversed second half using the `isMatch` method. [1 mark]
4. Restore the original list structure by reversing the second half again and reconnecting it to the first half. [1 mark] - The solution correctly restores the original list structure by reversing the second half again and reconnecting it. [1 mark]
