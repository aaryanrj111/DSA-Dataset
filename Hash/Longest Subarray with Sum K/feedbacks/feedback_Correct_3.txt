"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initialize a HashMap to store prefix sums as keys and their first occurrence indices as values, along with a result variable (= 0) and a prefixSum variable (= 0). [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly initializes a HashMap `map` to store prefix sums and their indices, and initializes `sum` and `maxLen` variables. [1 mark]

2. Iterate through the array once, adding each element to the prefixSum. [1 mark]  
   - The student iterates through the array and adds each element to `sum`. [1 mark]

3. For each position, check if the entire prefix from index 0 to current index has sum equal to k (prefixSum == k). If true, update result to current index + 1. [1 mark]  
   - The student checks if `sum == k` and updates `maxLen` to `i + 1` if true. [1 mark]

4. Check if (prefixSum - k) exists in the HashMap. If it exists, it means there's a subarray ending at current index with sum k, so update result by taking maximum of current result and (current index - index where (prefixSum - k) was found). [1 mark]  
   - The student checks if `sum - k` exists in the map and updates `maxLen` accordingly. [1 mark]

5. Store only the first occurrence of each prefix sum in the HashMap (to maximize subarray length). [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly stores only the first occurrence of each prefix sum in the map. [1 mark]
