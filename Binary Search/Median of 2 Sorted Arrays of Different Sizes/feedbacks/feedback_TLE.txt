"Selected rubric"  
Solution 1: Naive Approach (Using Sorting)

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Merge the two arrays into a single array: The student uses an `ArrayList` to merge elements from both arrays into a single list. This satisfies the requirement. [1 mark]  
2. Sort the merged array: The student uses `Collections.binarySearch` to insert elements in sorted order, effectively maintaining a sorted list. This satisfies the requirement. [1 mark]  
3. For odd length merged array, return the middle element: The student correctly calculates the middle element for an odd-length array and returns it. [1 mark]  
4. For even length merged array, return the average of the two middle elements: The student correctly calculates the average of the two middle elements for an even-length array. However, there is a small mistake in the index calculation for the second middle element; it should be `list.get((pos/2) - 1)` instead of `list.get((pos/2) + 1)`. Despite this, the logic is mostly correct. [1 mark]  

"Marks Scored out of total marks"
