Solution 2: Better Approach (Using Merge of Merge Sort)

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initialize two pointers to traverse the two arrays [1 mark]  
   - The solution initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the arrays `a` and `b`.  
   - Marks: 1/1

2. Traverse both arrays while keeping track of the middle elements [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly traverses both arrays using a while loop and merges them into a new array `arr`, without keeping track of the middle element. 
   - Marks: 0/1

3. Stop traversal when the combined count of elements reaches (n + m) / 2 [1 mark]  
   - The solution does not explicitly stop traversal at the middle point but continues until all elements are merged. However, it effectively keeps track of the middle elements by merging all elements and then calculating the median.  
   - Marks: 0/1

4. For odd total elements, return the middle element [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly returns the middle element when the total number of elements is odd.  
   - Marks: 1/1

5. For even total elements, return average of the two middle elements [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly calculates and returns the average of the two middle elements when the total number of elements is even.  
   - Marks: 1/1
