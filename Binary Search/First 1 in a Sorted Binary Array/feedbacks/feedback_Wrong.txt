Solution 3: Alternative Binary Search Implementation

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Set up tracking variable for potential answer [1 mark]  
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to -1 to track the potential answer. [1 mark]

2. Implement binary search with correct loop condition [1 mark]  
   - The binary search is implemented with the loop condition `while(si<ei)`, which is wrong. [0 mark]

3. Update tracking variable when potential match is found [1 mark]  
   - The tracking variable `ans` is updated when `arr[mid] == 1`. [1 mark]

4. Correctly narrow search space in each iteration [1 mark]  
   - The search space is narrowed incorrectly by adjusting `si` and `ei` based on the comparison results. [0 mark]

5. Return final result after search completion [1 mark]  
   - The function returns the final result stored in `ans`. [1 mark]
