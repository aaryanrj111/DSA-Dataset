Solution 2: Binary Search Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Implement binary search to find first occurrence with proper initialization [1 mark]  
   - The student initializes `low`, `high`, and `mid` correctly for binary search. [1 mark]

2. Correctly handle mid-point calculation and boundary conditions in first search [1 mark]  
   - The student calculates `mid` correctly using `(low + high) / 2`. [1 mark]

3. Properly narrow search range for first occurrence based on comparison results [2 marks]  
   - The student narrows the search range correctly using `high = mid - 1` and `low = mid + 1`. [2 marks]

4. Implement binary search to find last occurrence with proper initialization [1 mark]  
   - The student reinitializes `high` and uses `mid` correctly for the second search. [1 mark]

5. Correctly handle mid-point calculation and boundary conditions in second search [1 mark]  
   - The student calculates `temp` correctly using `(mid + high) / 2`. [1 mark]

6. Properly narrow search range for last occurrence based on comparison results [2 marks]  
   - The student narrows the search range correctly using `high = temp - 1` and `mid = temp + 1`. [2 marks]

7. Return appropriate result vector/array with both occurrences [1 mark]  
   - The student returns the correct list with both occurrences. [1 mark]
