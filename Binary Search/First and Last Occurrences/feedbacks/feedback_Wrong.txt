Solution 2: Binary Search Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Implement binary search to find first occurrence with proper initialization [1 mark] - The student correctly initializes the binary search for the first occurrence.  
2. Correctly handle mid-point calculation and boundary conditions in first search [1 mark] - The student correctly calculates the mid-point and handles boundary conditions.  
3. Properly narrow search range for first occurrence based on comparison results [2 marks] - The student correctly narrows the search range for the first occurrence.  
4. Implement binary search to find last occurrence with proper initialization [1 mark] - The student correctly initializes the binary search for the last occurrence.  
5. Correctly handle mid-point calculation and boundary conditions in second search [1 mark] - The student correctly calculates the mid-point and handles boundary conditions.  
6. Properly narrow search range for last occurrence based on comparison results [2 marks] - The student correctly narrows the search range for the last occurrence.  
7. Return appropriate result vector/array with both occurrences [1 mark] - The student correctly returns the result with both occurrences.
