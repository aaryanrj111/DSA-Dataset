Anagram:
   1. Check if two Strings are Anagrams of each other
   2. Solution 1:
      1. Initialize a map or dictionary or array to store the character frequencies. Initially, the frequency for each character should be zero. [1 mark]
      2. For each character in the first string, the corresponding frequency is incremented by 1. [1 mark]
      3. For each character in the second string, decrement its corresponding frequency by 1. [1 mark]
      4. Iterate through the entire map or dictionary or array. If any frequency is non-zero, then return false. Else return true. [1 mark]
   3. Solution 2:
      1. Initialize a map or dictionary or array to store the character frequencies. Initially, the frequency for each character should be zero. Keep separate data structures for each of the strings. [1 mark]
      2. For each character in the first string, the corresponding frequency in its data structure is incremented by 1. [1 mark]
      3. For each character in the second string, the corresponding frequency in its data structure is incremented by 1. [1 mark]
      4. Iterate through both the data structures. If the frequency for any unique character in both the data structures does not match, return false. Else return true. [1 mark]
   4. Solution 3:
      1. Sort both the strings. [2 marks]
      2. Return true if both the sorted strings are exactly same. Else, return false [2 marks]
