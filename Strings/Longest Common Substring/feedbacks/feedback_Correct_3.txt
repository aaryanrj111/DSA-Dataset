"Selected rubric"  
Solution 2: Dynamic Programming Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Create a 2D DP table of size (m+1) × (n+1) to store the length of common suffixes ending at each position. [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly initializes a 2D DP table `dp` of size `(s1.length() + 1) x (s2.length() + 1)`. [1 mark]

2. Initialize all values in the table to 0. [1 mark]  
   - The table is initialized to 0 by default in Java, which is correctly utilized by the student. [1 mark]

3. Fill the table in a bottom-up manner: if characters match, add 1 to the diagonal value, otherwise set to 0. [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly fills the table in a bottom-up manner, adding 1 to the diagonal value when characters match. [1 mark]

4. Keep track of the maximum value encountered in the table and return it as the result. [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly tracks the maximum value using the variable `ans` and returns it. [1 mark]
