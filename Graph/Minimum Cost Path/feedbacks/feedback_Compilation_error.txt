"Selected rubric"  
Solution 1: Dijkstra's Algorithm Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Create a data structure to store minimum costs to reach each cell, initialized with maximum value. [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not show any initialization of a data structure to store minimum costs.

2. Set up a priority-based data structure to process cells in order of minimum cost. [0 marks]  
   - There is no evidence of a priority-based data structure being set up in the submission.

3. Initialize the starting point with its cost in both data structures. [0 marks]  
   - The starting point is not initialized with its cost in any data structure.

4. Extract the minimum cost cell from the priority structure. [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not extract any cell from a priority structure.

5. Explore all four adjacent cells and update costs if cheaper paths are found. [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not explore adjacent cells or update costs.

6. Handle edge cases and boundary conditions correctly. [0 marks]  
   - There is no handling of edge cases or boundary conditions in the submission.

7. Return the minimum cost stored for the destination cell. [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not return any minimum cost for the destination cell.

"Marks Scored out of total marks"  
0 out of 7 marks
