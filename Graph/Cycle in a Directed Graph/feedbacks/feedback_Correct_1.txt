Solution 1: DFS with Recursion Stack

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initialize a visited array and a recursion stack array, both of size V to keep track of visited vertices and vertices in the current path. [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly initializes both `visited` and `rec` arrays of size `vertices`. [1 mark]

2. Mark the current vertex as visited and also mark it in the recursion stack during DFS traversal. [1 mark]  
   - The solution marks the current vertex as visited and in the recursion stack in the `dfs` method. [1 mark]

3. For each adjacent unvisited vertex, recursively call the DFS function. If a vertex is reached that is already in the recursion stack, return true (cycle detected). [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly checks for each adjacent vertex and returns true if a vertex is found in the recursion stack. [1 mark]

4. Implement a wrapper function that calls DFS for all unvisited vertices and returns the final result correctly. [1 mark]  
   - The `isCyclic` function serves as a wrapper that calls DFS for all unvisited vertices and returns the correct result. [1 mark]
