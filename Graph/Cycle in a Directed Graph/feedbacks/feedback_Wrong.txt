Solution 2: Kahn's Algorithm (BFS Topological Sort)

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Calculate the in-degree for each vertex in the graph using an array of size V. [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not calculate the in-degree for each vertex, which is a crucial step in Kahn's Algorithm.

2. Initialize a queue with all vertices having in-degree 0 and maintain a counter for processed vertices. [0 marks]  
   - The submission initializes a queue but does not correctly implement the logic to add vertices with in-degree 0 or maintain a counter for processed vertices.

3. Perform BFS traversal: for each vertex removed from queue, decrement in-degree of all its neighbors and add vertices with in-degree 0 to the queue. [0 marks]  
   - The submission performs a BFS traversal but does not decrement in-degrees or add vertices with in-degree 0 to the queue, which is essential for detecting cycles using Kahn's Algorithm.

4. If the number of processed vertices is less than V, return true (cycle exists); otherwise, return false (no cycle). [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not implement the logic to check the number of processed vertices against V to determine the presence of a cycle.
