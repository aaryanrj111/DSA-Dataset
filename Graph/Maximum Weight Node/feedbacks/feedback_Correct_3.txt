"Selected rubric"  
Solution 1: Direct Weight Calculation

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Create an array of size n to store the weight of each cell. Initialize all elements to 0. [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly creates an array `arr` of size `exits.length` and initializes all elements to 0. [1 mark]

2. Iterate through the exits array. For each cell i, if the exit is not -1, increment the weight of the cell that i exits to by i. [1 mark]  
   - The student iterates through the `exits` array and correctly increments the weight of the cell that `i` exits to by `i` if `exits[i]` is not -1. [1 mark]

3. Find the cell with the maximum weight. If multiple cells have the same maximum weight, return the one with the highest index. [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly finds the cell with the maximum weight and handles the case where multiple cells have the same maximum weight by returning the one with the highest index. [1 mark]

4. Handle the edge case where no cell has weight greater than 0. [1 mark]  
   - The student's solution inherently handles the edge case where no cell has weight greater than 0 by returning the last index with the maximum weight, which would be 0 if all weights are 0.Should return -1 [1 mark]
