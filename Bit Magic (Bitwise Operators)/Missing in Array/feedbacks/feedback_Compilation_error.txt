"Feedback with marks"
1. Initialize a variable to store the expected sum of integers from 1 to n (n*(n+1)/2) [1 mark] - Correctly implemented. The expected sum is calculated using the formula n*(n+1)/2. [1 mark]
2. Calculate the actual sum of all elements in the array [1 mark] - The code attempts to calculate the actual sum by subtracting each element from the expected sum, which is a valid approach. However, there is a syntax error in the loop condition `nums-1.length` which should be `nums.length`. [0 mark]
3. Return the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum [1 mark] - The code returns the difference correctly. [1 mark]
4. Correctly handle integer overflow considerations for large values of n [1 mark] - The code does not explicitly handle integer overflow, which is important for large values of n. [0 mark]
