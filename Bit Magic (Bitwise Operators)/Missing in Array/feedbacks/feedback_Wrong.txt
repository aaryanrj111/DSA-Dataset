Solution 4: Binary Search Approach (for sorted array)

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Check if array is sorted and sort if necessary [1 mark]  
   - The solution sorts the array using `Arrays.sort(arr);`. This satisfies the requirement. [1 mark]

2. Implement binary search to find the first position where the element value doesn't match its expected position [2 marks]  
   - The solution uses a linear search instead of a binary search to find the mismatch. This does not satisfy the requirement for binary search. [0 marks]

3. Calculate the missing element based on the discrepancy found [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly identifies the missing element by returning `i+1` when `arr[i] != i+1`. [1 mark]
