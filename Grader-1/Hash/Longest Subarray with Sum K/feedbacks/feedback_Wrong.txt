"Selected rubric"  
Solution 1

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initialize a variable to track the maximum subarray length (result = 0). [1 mark]  
   - Feedback: The student initializes `len` to track the maximum subarray length. This satisfies the rubric point. [1 mark]

2. Use nested loops to consider all possible subarrays - outer loop for starting point, inner loop for ending point. [1 mark]  
   - Feedback: The student uses nested loops with `i` and `j` to consider all possible subarrays. This satisfies the rubric point. [1 mark]

3. For each subarray, calculate its sum by adding elements one by one. [1 mark]  
   - Feedback: The student calculates the sum of each subarray using a loop from `start` to `end`. This satisfies the rubric point. [1 mark]

4. When a subarray with sum equal to k is found, calculate its length (j - i + 1) and update result if this length is greater than the current result. [1 mark]  
   - Feedback: The student  doesn't checks if the current sum equals `k` and updates `len` if the current subarray length is greater. This satisfies the rubric point. [0 mark]
