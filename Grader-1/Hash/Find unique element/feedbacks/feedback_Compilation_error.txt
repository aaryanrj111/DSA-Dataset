Solution 1: using bitwise AND

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Create an array to count how many times each bit position (from 0 to 31) is set to 1 in the binary representation of all elements. [0 marks]  
   - The student did not create an array to count the bits; instead, they used a single integer `sum` to count the bits for each position.

2. For each bit position, check if it is set in each element of the array. If it is, increment the corresponding count in the count array. [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly iterates over each bit position and checks if it is set in each element, incrementing `sum` accordingly.

3. For each bit position, check if the count of set bits is not a multiple of k. These bits are part of the unique element. [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly checks if `sum % k != 0` to determine if the bit is part of the unique element.

4. Combine the bits that are not a multiple of k to form the binary representation of the unique element. [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly combines these bits using `result |= (1 << i)`.

5. Divide the result by the frequency of the unique element to ensure correctness. [0 marks]  
   - The student did not divide the result by the frequency of the unique element.

6. Output the unique element that appears fewer times than the others. [0 marks]  
   - The student did not return or output the result.
