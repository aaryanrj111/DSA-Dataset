"Selected rubric"  
Solution 3: Using hashing

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initialize a HashMap to keep track of how many times each element appears in the array. [1 mark] - The student correctly initializes a HashMap to track the frequency of each element. [1 mark]  
2. Iterate through the array and update the frequency of each element in the HashMap. [1 mark] - The student iterates through the array and updates the frequency of each element in the HashMap correctly. [1 mark]  
3. Check the frequency of each element in the HashMap to identify the one that does not appear a multiple of **k** times. [1 mark] - The student checks the frequency of each element to find the one that does not appear a multiple of k times. [1 mark]  
4. If an element with a frequency that is not a multiple of **k** is found, return it as the unique element. [1 mark] - The student correctly returns the element that does not appear a multiple of k times. [1 mark]  
5. If no unique element is found after checking all elements, return a default value (e.g., -1). [1 mark] - The student does not explicitly return a default value if no unique element is found, but the logic ensures a unique element is returned if it exists. [0 marks]
