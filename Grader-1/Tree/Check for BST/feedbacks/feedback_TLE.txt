Solution 1: Min-Max Range Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Create a helper function that takes a node, minimum value, and maximum value as parameters [0 mark]  
   - The solution does not implement a helper function with min and max parameters.  
2. Return true if the node is null (base case) [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly returns true if the root is null.  
3. Check if current node's value violates the valid range (< min or > max); if so, return false [0 mark]  
   - The solution checks if the current node's value violates the BST property using max and min functions, but it does not use a range approach.  
4. Recursively validate left subtree with updated maximum as current node's value [0 mark]  
   - The solution does not update the maximum value for the left subtree.  
5. Recursively validate right subtree with updated minimum as current node's value [0 mark]  
   - The solution does not update the minimum value for the right subtree.  
6. Return true only if both left and right subtrees are valid BSTs [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly returns true only if both left and right subtrees are valid BSTs.
