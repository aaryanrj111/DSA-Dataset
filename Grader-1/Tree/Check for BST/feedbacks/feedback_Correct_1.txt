Solution 1: Min-Max Range Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Create a helper function that takes a node, minimum value, and maximum value as parameters [1 mark]  
   - The student has implemented a helper function `BST` that takes `Node root`, `Node min`, and `Node max` as parameters. [1 mark]

2. Return true if the node is null (base case) [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly returns true if `root` is null. [1 mark]

3. Check if current node's value violates the valid range (< min or > max); if so, return false [1 mark]  
   - The student checks if `root.data` is less than or equal to `min.data` or greater than or equal to `max.data` and returns false if so. [1 mark]

4. Recursively validate left subtree with updated maximum as current node's value [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly calls `BST` on the left subtree with `root` as the new maximum. [1 mark]

5. Recursively validate right subtree with updated minimum as current node's value [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly calls `BST` on the right subtree with `root` as the new minimum. [1 mark]

6. Return true only if both left and right subtrees are valid BSTs [1 mark]  
   - The student returns the result of the logical AND operation between the left and right subtree validations. [1 mark]
