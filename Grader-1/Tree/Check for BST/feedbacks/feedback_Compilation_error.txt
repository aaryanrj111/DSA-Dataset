Solution 1: Min-Max Range Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Create a helper function that takes a node, minimum value, and maximum value as parameters [1 mark]  
   - The helper function is correctly defined with parameters for the node, min, and max values. [1 mark]

2. Return true if the node is null (base case) [1 mark]  
   - The base case correctly returns true when the node is null. [1 mark]

3. Check if current node's value violates the valid range (< min or > max); if so, return false [1 mark]  
   - The code checks if the current node's value is less than or equal to min or greater than or equal to max, which is correct. [1 mark]

4. Recursively validate left subtree with updated maximum as current node's value [1 mark]  
   - The left subtree is validated with the current node's value as the new max, which is correct. [1 mark]

5. Recursively validate right subtree with updated minimum as current node's value [1 mark]  
   - The right subtree is validated with the current node's value as the new min, which is correct. [1 mark]

6. Return true only if both left and right subtrees are valid BSTs [1 mark]  
   - The function returns true only if both recursive calls for left and right subtrees return true, which is correct. [1 mark]
