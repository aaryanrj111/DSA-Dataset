Selected rubric: Solution 2: Using LCA â€“ O(n) Time and O(h) Space

Feedback with marks:
1. Handle null check and target node checks for LCA [1 mark] - The code does not explicitly handle null checks for LCA, so 0 marks.
2. Recursively search left and right subtrees for LCA [1 mark] - The code does not implement a recursive search for LCA, so 0 marks.
3. Determine LCA based on search results [1 mark] - The code does not determine LCA based on search results, so 0 marks.
4. Return appropriate node [1 mark] - The code does not return the appropriate node for LCA, so 0 marks.
5. Handle null check: return -1 if root is null for level finding [1 mark] - The code does not handle null check for level finding, so 0 marks.
6. Return level if root.data equals target value [1 mark] - The code does not return level if root.data equals target value, so 0 marks.
7. Recursively search left and right subtrees, incrementing level [1 mark] - The code does recursively search left and right subtrees for level, so 1 marks.
8. Return appropriate level or -1 based on search results [1 mark] - The code does not return appropriate level or -1 based on search results, so 0 marks.
9. Find the LCA of the two nodes [1 mark] - The code does not find the LCA of the two nodes, so 0 marks.
10. Calculate distance from LCA to first node [1 mark] - The code does not calculate distance from LCA to first node, so 0 marks.
11. Calculate distance from LCA to second node [1 mark] - The code does not calculate distance from LCA to second node, so 0 marks.
12. Return the sum of these distances [1 mark] - The code does not return the sum of these distances, so 0 marks.
