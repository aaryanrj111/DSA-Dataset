"Feedback with marks"  
1. Handle null check and target node checks for LCA [1 mark] - The code correctly handles null checks and target node checks in the LCA method. [1 mark]  
2. Recursively search left and right subtrees for LCA [1 mark] - The code correctly searches left and right subtrees for LCA. [1 mark]  
3. Determine LCA based on search results [1 mark] - The code correctly determines the LCA based on search results. [1 mark]  
4. Return appropriate node [1 mark] - The code returns the appropriate node as LCA. [1 mark]  
5. Handle null check: return -1 if root is null for level finding [1 mark] - The code correctly returns -1 if the root is null in the lcaDist method. [1 mark]  
6. Return level if root.data equals target value [1 mark] - The code returns 0 if root.data equals the target value in the lcaDist method. [1 mark]  
7. Recursively search left and right subtrees, incrementing level [1 mark] - The code correctly searches left and right subtrees, incrementing the level. [1 mark]  
8. Return appropriate level or -1 based on search results [1 mark] - The code returns the appropriate level or -1 based on search results. [1 mark]  
9. Find the LCA of the two nodes [1 mark] - The code correctly finds the LCA of the two nodes. [1 mark]  
10. Calculate distance from LCA to first node [1 mark] - The code calculates the distance from LCA to the first node correctly. [1 mark]  
11. Calculate distance from LCA to second node [1 mark] - The code calculates the distance from LCA to the second node correctly. [1 mark]  
12. Return the sum of these distances [1 mark] - The code returns the sum of these distances correctly. [1 mark]
