Solution 1: Brute Force Approach (Linear Search)

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initialize variables to track first and last occurrences [1 mark]  
   - The solution initializes an `ArrayList<Integer> ans` to store the first and last occurrences. [1 mark]

2. Correctly traverse the array from left to right [1 mark]  
   - The solution uses a for loop to traverse the array from left to right. [1 mark]

3. Properly update first occurrence when element is first found [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly updates the first occurrence when the element is first found by adding the index to `ans`. [1 mark]

4. Consistently update last occurrence on each encounter of the target element [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly updates the last occurrence by traversing from the end of the array and adding the index to `ans`. [1 mark]

5. Return appropriate result with both occurrences or [-1, -1] if not found [1 mark]  
   - The solution returns the correct result with both occurrences or [-1, -1] if the element is not found. [1 mark]
