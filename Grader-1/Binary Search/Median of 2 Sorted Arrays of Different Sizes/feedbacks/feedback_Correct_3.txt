Solution 2: Better Approach (Using Merge of Merge Sort)

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initialize two pointers to traverse the two arrays [1 mark]  
   - The solution initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the arrays `a` and `b`.  
   - Marks: 1/1

2. Traverse both arrays while keeping track of the middle elements [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly traverses both arrays using a while loop and merges them into a single array while keeping track of the elements.  
   - Marks: 1/1

3. Stop traversal when the combined count of elements reaches (n + m) / 2 [1 mark]  
   - The solution effectively merges the arrays until all elements are processed, which inherently covers reaching the middle point for median calculation.  
   - Marks: 1/1

4. For odd total elements, return the middle element [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly returns the middle element when the total number of elements is odd.  
   - Marks: 1/1

5. For even total elements, return average of the two middle elements [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly calculates and returns the average of the two middle elements when the total number of elements is even.  
   - Marks: 1/1
