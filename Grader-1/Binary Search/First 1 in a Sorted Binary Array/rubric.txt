First 1 in a Sorted Binary Array
Solution 1: Binary Search Approach
1. Initialize pointers to track the search range [1 mark]
2. Implement a binary search loop with proper termination conditions [1 mark]
3. Check if the current element is the first occurrence of 1 with appropriate boundary checks [2 marks]
4. Correctly adjust search range based on comparison results [2 marks]
5. Return appropriate value when no match is found [1 mark]

Solution 2: Linear Search Approach
1. Iterate through the array in a single pass [2 marks]
2. Correctly identify and return the first occurrence of 1 [2 marks]
3. Handle the case when no 1 is present in the array [1 mark]

Solution 3: Alternative Binary Search Implementation
1. Set up tracking variable for potential answer [1 mark]
2. Implement binary search with correct loop condition [1 mark]
3. Update tracking variable when potential match is found [1 mark]
4. Correctly narrow search space in each iteration [1 mark]
5. Return final result after search completion [1 mark]
