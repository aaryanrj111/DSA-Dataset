"Selected rubric"  
Solution 2: Linear Search Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Iterate through the array in a single pass [2 marks]  
   - The solution iterates through the array using a for loop, which satisfies this criterion. [2 marks]

2. Correctly identify and return the first occurrence of 1 [2 marks]  
   - The solution correctly identifies the first occurrence of 1 and returns its index. [2 marks]

3. Handle the case when no 1 is present in the array [1 mark]  
   - The solution checks if the last element is 0 and returns -1 if true, which handles the case when no 1 is present. [1 mark]
