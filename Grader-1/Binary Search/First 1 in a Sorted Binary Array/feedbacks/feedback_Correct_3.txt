"Selected rubric"  
Solution 2: Linear Search Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Iterate through the array in a single pass [2 marks]  
   - The solution iterates through the array using a for loop, which satisfies this criterion. [2 marks]

2. Correctly identify and return the first occurrence of 1 [2 marks]  
   - The solution correctly identifies the first occurrence of 1 and returns its index immediately. [2 marks]

3. Handle the case when no 1 is present in the array [1 mark]  
   - The solution returns -1 if no 1 is found, which handles this case correctly. [1 mark]

"Marks Scored out of total marks"  
5 out of 5 marks
