"Selected rubric"  
Solution 1: The student's approach involves checking character presence, which is closest to the idea of using a frequency map, although it doesn't fully implement it.

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initialize a map or dictionary or array to store the character frequencies. Initially, the frequency for each character should be zero. [0 marks]  
   - The student did not initialize any data structure to store character frequencies.

2. For each character in the first string, the corresponding frequency is incremented by 1. [0 marks]  
   - The student did not increment frequencies for characters in the first string.

3. For each character in the second string, decrement its corresponding frequency by 1. [0 marks]  
   - The student did not decrement frequencies for characters in the second string.

4. Iterate through the entire map or dictionary or array. If any frequency is non-zero, then return false. Else return true. [0 marks]  
   - The student did not use a frequency map or similar data structure to check for non-zero frequencies.
