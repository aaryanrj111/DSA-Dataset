"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initialize a map or dictionary or array to store the character frequencies. Initially, the frequency for each character should be zero. [1 mark]  
   - The student initializes an array `count` of size 26 to store character frequencies, which is correct. [1 mark]

2. For each character in the first string, the corresponding frequency is incremented by 1. [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly increments the frequency for each character in the first string `s1`. [1 mark]

3. For each character in the second string, decrement its corresponding frequency by 1. [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly decrements the frequency for each character in the second string `s2`. [1 mark]

4. Iterate through the entire map or dictionary or array. If any frequency is non-zero, then return false. Else return true. [1 mark]  
   - The student iterates through the `count` array and returns false if any frequency is non-zero, otherwise returns true. [1 mark]
