Solution 1: Naive Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Start the loop from the second element to the second-to-last element. Skip the first and last elements since they cannot trap water. Ensure systematic processing of potential water-trapping positions. [1 mark]  
   - The loop starts from the second element and ends at the second-to-last element, correctly skipping the first and last elements. [1 mark]

2. Find the maximum height on the left of the current element. Initialize left with the current element's height. Traverse from start of the array to the current index. Update left with the maximum height encountered. [1 mark]  
   - The solution uses a `leftMax` array to store the maximum height to the left of each element, correctly updating it as it traverses the array. [1 mark]

3. Find the maximum height on the right of the current element. Initialize right with the current element's height. Traverse from current index to end of array. Update right with the maximum height encountered. [1 mark]  
   - The solution uses a `rightMax` array to store the maximum height to the right of each element, correctly updating it as it traverses the array. [1 mark]

4. Calculate water trapped at the current index. Use the formula: Math.min(left, right) - arr[i]. Determines trapped water based on the shorter of the left and right heights. Subtracts the current element's height to get trapped water. [2 marks]  
   - The solution correctly calculates the trapped water at each index using the formula `Math.min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - arr[i]`. [2 marks]

5. Ensure that trapped water is non-negative before adding to the result. Prevents incorrect accumulation due to height discrepancies. [1 mark]  
   - The solution inherently ensures non-negative trapped water by using the `Math.min` function, which prevents negative values. [1 mark]

6. Add the calculated trapped water at the current index to res. Continuously updates the total trapped water. Builds a cumulative result throughout the iteration. [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly accumulates the trapped water in the `res` variable. [1 mark]

7. Ensure proper handling of empty arrays or arrays with less than 3 elements (should return 0). [1 mark]  
   - The solution does not explicitly handle arrays with less than 3 elements, but the loop structure inherently prevents errors in such cases. [1 mark]

8. Consider cases where all bars are of equal height (should return 0). [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly handles cases where all bars are of equal height, as the `Math.min` function would result in zero trapped water. [1 mark]

9. Return the total trapped water stored in res. Provides the final computed result for the entire array. [1 mark]  
   - The solution correctly returns the total trapped water stored in `res`. [1 mark]
