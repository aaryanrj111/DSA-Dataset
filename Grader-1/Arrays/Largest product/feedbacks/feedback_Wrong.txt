"Selected rubric"  
Solution 2: Brute Force Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Correctly sets up nested loops to examine all subarrays of size k [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not set up nested loops to examine all subarrays of size k. It directly calculates the product of a specific subarray.
2. Properly calculates product of each subarray by multiplying all elements [0 marks]  
   - The submission calculates the product of elements but not for all subarrays of size k.
3. Maintains and updates the maximum product found across all subarrays [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not maintain or update the maximum product found.
4. Handles edge cases such as when array length is less than k [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not handle edge cases where the array length is less than k.
5. Analyzes time complexity as O(n*k) and space complexity as O(1) [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not analyze time or space complexity.
