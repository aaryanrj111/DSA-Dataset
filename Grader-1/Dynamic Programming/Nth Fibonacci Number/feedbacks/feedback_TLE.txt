"Selected rubric"  
Solution 1 (Naive Approach - Recursion)

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Implement base cases: if n â‰¤ 1, return n. [0 marks]  
   - Feedback: The base case is incorrectly implemented. The condition should be `if(n <= 1) return n;` but the code uses `if(n >= 1) return n;`, which is incorrect.

2. For n > 1, recursively calculate F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). [2 marks]  
   - Feedback: The recursive calculation is correctly implemented as `return nthFibonacci(n-1) + nthFibonacci(n-2);`.

3. Return the final result for the nth Fibonacci number. [1 mark]  
   - Feedback: The function correctly returns the result of the recursive calculation.
