"Selected rubric"  
Solution 5: Linear Search Approach

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Create a boolean array or hash set to mark present elements [0 marks]  
   - The student used an `ArrayList` to store elements instead of a boolean array or hash set. This does not meet the rubric criteria.

2. Iterate through the input array and mark each element as present [1 mark]  
   - The student iterated through the input array and added each element to the `ArrayList`, which is equivalent to marking them as present.

3. Scan through the boolean array or hash set to find the first unmarked element [0 marks]  
   - The student used a loop to check for the missing element, but since they did not use a boolean array or hash set, this does not meet the rubric criteria.

4. Return the missing number correctly [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly identified and returned the missing number by checking which number from 1 to n is not present in the list.
