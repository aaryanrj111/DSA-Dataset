"Selected rubric"  
Solution 4: Binary Search Approach (for sorted array)

"Feedback with marks"
1. Check if array is sorted and sort if necessary [1 mark] - The student sorts the array using `Arrays.sort(arr);`. This satisfies the requirement. [1 mark]
2. Implement binary search to find the first position where the element value doesn't match its expected position [2 marks] - The student uses a while loop to find the first position where the element value doesn't match its expected position. This is effectively a linear search, not a binary search. [0 marks]
3. Calculate the missing element based on the discrepancy found [1 mark] - The student correctly calculates and returns the missing element based on the discrepancy found. [1 mark]
