"Selected rubric: Solution 2: Optimal Approach (Using XOR)"

"Feedback with marks"
1. Calculate the XOR of all elements in the array (this will give XOR of the two non-repeating numbers) [1 mark] - The student correctly calculates the XOR of all elements in the array. [1 mark]
2. Find the rightmost set bit in the XOR result [1 mark] - The student correctly finds the rightmost set bit in the XOR result. [1 mark]
3. Divide the elements into two groups: one with the bit set and another with the bit not set [1 mark] - The student attempts to divide the elements into two groups, but there is a mistake in the condition used for grouping. The condition `((arr[i] ^ pos)&1) == 1` is incorrect; it should be `((arr[i] >> pos)&1) == 1`. [0 marks]
4. XOR all elements in the first group to get the first non-repeating element [1 mark] - Due to the incorrect grouping condition, the XOR operation does not correctly isolate the first non-repeating element. [0 marks]
5. XOR all elements in the second group to get the second non-repeating element [1 mark] - Similarly, the XOR operation does not correctly isolate the second non-repeating element due to the incorrect grouping condition. [0 marks]
6. Return the two elements in increasing order [1 mark] - The student correctly sorts and returns the two elements in increasing order. [1 mark]
