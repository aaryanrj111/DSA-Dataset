"Selected rubric"  
Solution 1: DFS with Recursion Stack

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initialize a visited array and a recursion stack array, both of size V to keep track of visited vertices and vertices in the current path. [0 mark]  
   - Feedback: The solution initializes a `path` array to keep track of the current path, but it does not explicitly initialize a separate visited array. The `path` array is used for both purposes, which is not exactly as per the rubric.

2. Mark the current vertex as visited and also mark it in the recursion stack during DFS traversal. [1 mark]  
   - Feedback: The solution correctly marks the current vertex in the `path` array during DFS traversal.

3. For each adjacent unvisited vertex, recursively call the DFS function. If a vertex is reached that is already in the recursion stack, return true (cycle detected). [1 mark]  
   - Feedback: The solution correctly checks if a vertex is already in the `path` array and sets `bool[0]` to 1 if a cycle is detected.

4. Implement a wrapper function that calls DFS for all unvisited vertices and returns the final result correctly. [0 mark]  
   - Feedback: The solution does not correctly implement a wrapper function to call DFS only for unvisited vertices. It calls DFS for all vertices without checking if they are unvisited, which is not as per the rubric.
