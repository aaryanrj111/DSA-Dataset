"Selected rubric"  
Solution 2: BFS with Priority Structure

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Set up a priority structure to store cells sorted by accumulated cost. [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not use a priority structure to store cells sorted by accumulated cost. Instead, it uses a dynamic programming approach with arrays `prev` and `curr`.

2. Create a structure to track processed cells. [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not explicitly track processed cells. It uses arrays to store the minimum cost to reach each cell.

3. Start from the initial cell and explore in order of minimum accumulated cost. [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not explore cells in order of minimum accumulated cost using a priority structure. It calculates costs iteratively using dynamic programming.

4. Check neighboring cells and update costs if better paths are found. [1 mark]  
   - The submission correctly checks neighboring cells (up and left) and updates costs if a cheaper path is found.

5. Add cells to priority structure based on updated costs. [0 marks]  
   - The submission does not add cells to a priority structure. It updates costs directly in the arrays.

6. Properly handle grid boundaries. [1 mark]  
   - The submission correctly handles grid boundaries by checking conditions `i > 0` and `j > 0`.

7. Return the minimum cost when reaching the destination cell. [0 marks]  
   - The submission returns the minimum cost stored in `prev[n-1]`, but this does not align with the BFS approach using a priority structure.
