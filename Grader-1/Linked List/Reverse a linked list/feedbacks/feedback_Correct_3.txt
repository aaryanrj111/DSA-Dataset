"Selected rubric"  
Solution 1: Iterative Approach (O(n) Time, O(1) Space)

"Feedback with marks"  
1. Initialize pointers: prev as NULL, curr as head, and next as NULL. [1 mark]  
   - The student correctly initializes `prev` as `null` and `curr` as `head`. The `next` pointer is not explicitly initialized as `null`, but it is not necessary for the logic, so this is acceptable. [1 mark]

2. Traverse the linked list, reversing pointers at each step. [2 marks]  
   - The student correctly traverses the linked list using a `while` loop and reverses the pointers at each step by using a temporary variable `temp` to store `curr.next`, then setting `curr.next` to `prev`, updating `prev` to `curr`, and finally updating `curr` to `temp`. [2 marks]

3. Update the head pointer to point to the new first node (previously the last node). [1 mark]  
   - The student returns `prev`, which is the new head of the reversed list. [1 mark]
